# ultimate_tictactoe
tictactoe with unlimited squares. Or just 3x3.

Just some vanilla JS practice really. Not much put into the UI or css. Vanilla JS that is stateful with a render method.
User can change the boardState with a button or customize it more within the script. More than two players are allowed similarly by altering the player state manually.

3x3 -> win state is normal.
5x5+ -> win state requires 5 in a row.
